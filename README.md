Online Web Compiler with GDB using WebSocket
This project is an online web-based compiler powered by GDB (GNU Debugger) and WebSocket technology. It enables users to compile, debug, and run code directly from their web browsers, providing a seamless coding experience with real-time interaction between the client and server.

Features
Code Compilation and Execution: Allows users to compile and execute code in various programming languages directly in the browser.
Real-Time Debugging: Uses GDB to provide step-by-step debugging, breakpoints, and error inspection.
WebSocket-Based Communication: WebSocket facilitates instant, bidirectional communication between the client and server, ensuring smooth and efficient debugging sessions.
User-Friendly Interface: Interactive editor and console output for easy use and real-time feedback.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
